## What is `rsbu`

`rsbu` aims to be a simple, fast and light weight backup utility.

`rsbu` is a filesystem snapshot utility based on modern `rsync` (>3.1.0) which
supports multiple `--link-dest` arguments and modern `bash` (>4.1) which
supports the array variable.  `rsbu` is written entirely in the `bash` shell
script and a highly customizable wrapper for `rsync`..

`rsbu` started as root with the default configuration at `/etc/rsbu.conf`
makes a snapshot of local machine directory `/home`, `/etc`, and `/usr/local`
under the timestamed subdirectory of the local directory `/var/cache/rsbu/`
while using he older backup data efficiently with hardlinks.

`rsbu` started as a user with the example configuration copied to
`~/.rsbu.conf` makes a snapshot of local machine directory `~/Documents` under
the timestamed subdirectory of the local directory `~/rsbu/` while using he
older backup data efficiently with hardlinks.

`rsbu` may be started with a custom configuration with the `-c` option.

The timestamped directory has the `rsbu_sucess` file if rync exit with
success.  This is used as a marker when finding the last valid backup.

You can customize these configuration settings.  If `ssh` access is available,
remote machine data may be backed up to the local machine.

Since `rsbu` is a simple wrapper around `rsync`, you can use full feature of
`rsync` via its configuration.  For example, you can execute any custom
scripts before and after the `rsync` execution, can filter out some data from
the data to be backed up, and can back up remote machine data.

`rsbu` should be easily adopted to any reasonably modern UNIX compatible OSs.
But currently, `rsbu` is developed and focused on Debian GNU/Linux (>9) only.

No de-duplication effort is deployed in the default setting.  A companion
utility program to address this concern for files which may be moved around and
renamed needs be developed soon.

## How to use `rsbu` for the system backup

You can make the sanity check of the system configuration file
`/etc/rsbu.conf` with:

```
 $ sudo rsbu
```

You can make snapshot backup any time with:

```
 $ sudo rsbu backup
```

This will backup your local `/etc/`, `/home/`, and `/usr/local/` directory
contents to the directory tree under
`/var/cache/rsbu/`*ISO_8601_format_seconds*`/` with the default configuration
settings.

The actual back up behavior can be customized by editing the `backup` function
defined in `/etc/rsbu.conf`.  This configuration file is source by
`/usr/bin/rsbu`.

You can list older backup data any time with:

```
 $ sudo rsbu list
```

Here,

* `del` is the time difference in second. 
* `age` is the aging index which slowly increases as the `del` becomes bigger.

You can prune older backup data any time with:

```
 $ sudo rsbu prune
```

This pruning procedure keeps recent backup data in high frequency while the
older backup data are made to be sparse by dropping them using the aging
index.

## How to use `rsbu` for the user backup

Let's set up the user configuration file `~/.rsbu.conf` from the example.

```
 $ cp /usr/share/doc/rsbu/examples/.rsbu.conf ~/.rsbu.conf
```

You can make the sanity check of the user configuration file `~/.rsbu.conf`
with:

```
 $ rsbu
```

TIP: If the current directory has `.rsbu.conf` in it, `.rsbu.conf` is used
instead.

You can make snapshot backup any time with:

```
 $ rsbu backup
```

This will backup your local `~/Documents/` directory contents to the directory
tree under `~/rsbu/`*ISO_8601_format_seconds*`/` with the default
configuration settings.

The actual back up behavior can be customized by editing the `backup` function
defined in `~/.rsbu.conf`.  This configuration file is source by
`/usr/bin/rsbu`.

You can list older backup data any time with:

```
 $ rsbu list
```

Here,

* `del` is the time difference in second. 
* `age` is the aging index which slowly increases as the `del` becomes bigger.

You can prune older backup data any time with:

```
 $ rsbu prune
```

This pruning procedure keeps recent backup data in high frequency while the
older backup data are made to be sparse by dropping them.

## How to set up for `cron`/`anacron`

Adding a file with the following content in `/etc/cron.d/` automates your
backup job with `cron` to be executed every 15 minutes:

```
 */4 * * * *     /usr/bin/rsbu backup
```

Adding a file with the following content in `/etc/cron.daily/` automates your
pruning job with `cron`/`anacron` to be executed everyday sometime even if
you are on the intermittently used desktop system:

```
test -x /usr/bin/rsbu || exit 0
/usr/bin/rsbu prune
```

## How to speed up `rsbu prune`

If the user write permission of the directory is disabled, `rsbu prune`
becomes slow.  This happens often when the whole directory tree is copied from
the read-only removable media such as CD and DVD.  The following should fix
it.

```
 $ cd path/to/<data_dir>
 $ find  . -type d -exec chmod u+w "{}" \;
```

## How to keep data safe

In order to keep data safe from the data loss, it is important to keep the
backup data to be on the different disk drive from the original data.

Tweaking the `/etc/fstab` to mount a different drive on the backup data
directory is one way.  Tweaking udev rules for the removable storage device is
another approach.

## Thought for writing `rsbu`

* compatibility with the desktop system
* manual and automated random interval backup
* make code readable and edittable as much as possible
* easy debug (run with `-x` option to get command trace)
* accept very short command name: `rsbu b` instead of `rsbu backup`

The author thanks [rsnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org/) script in `perl` which
gave me motivation and inspiration to write this script in `bash` shell.

[rsnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org/) examples should provides interesting
refined backup tricks such as LVM snapshot.
